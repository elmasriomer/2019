This is followed by data for each of the employees. The first number for each employee is an integer that specifies their pay per hour in cents. Following this are 5 integers, the number of hours they worked on each of the days of the workweek. Given this data, write a loop and any necessary code that reads the data and stores the total payroll of all employees into the variable total. Note that you will have to add up the numbers worked by each employee and multiply that by that particular employee's pay rate to get the employee's pay for the week-- and sum those values into total."
